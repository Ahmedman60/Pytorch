# Absolutely! Letâ€™s walk through the **character frequency technique** in a simple and visual way so you really get whatâ€™s happening and why it works for **grouping anagrams**.

# ---

# ## ðŸ’¡ Why Character Frequency Works

# Two strings are **anagrams** if:
# - They contain **the exact same letters**
# - **Each letter appears the same number of times**

# ðŸ‘‰ So instead of sorting, we can just **count how many times each letter appears** in each word.

# ---

# ## ðŸ”¢ Character Frequency Representation

# Imagine you're working with lowercase English letters only.

# You create a **list of length 26** (one for each letter from `'a'` to `'z'`), and for each character in the word, you **increment the count** at the corresponding index.

# Example:

# ### Word: `"eat"`

# - `'e'` â†’ index 4
# - `'a'` â†’ index 0
# - `'t'` â†’ index 19

# So the count array becomes:

# ```python
# [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]
# # indexes 0 = a, 4 = e, 19 = t
# ```

# This becomes the **key** for grouping. Any other word with the same letter counts (like `"tea"` or `"ate"`) will produce **exactly the same count array** â†’ so they go in the same group.

# ---

# ## âœ… Code Walkthrough

# ```python
# from collections import defaultdict

# def groupAnagrams(strs):
#     hash_map = defaultdict(list)

#     for word in strs:
#         count = [0] * 26  # start with 0s for each letter

#         for c in word:
#             count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1  # convert char to index

#         key = tuple(count)  # must be immutable to use as dict key
#         hash_map[key].append(word)

#     return list(hash_map.values())
# ```

# ---

# ## ðŸ§  Why `tuple(count)` is used

# - `list` is **not hashable**, so it canâ€™t be used as a dictionary key.
# - `tuple` is immutable and hashable â€” perfect as a unique representation of each anagram group.

# ---

# ## ðŸ“Š Real Example

# Input:
# ```python
# ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
# ```

# Character frequency keys:

# | Word | Frequency Tuple (non-zero counts only for clarity)       | Group      |
# |------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
# | eat  | `('a':1, 'e':1, 't':1)` â†’ `(1,0,0,0,1,...,1...)`         | Group A    |
# | tea  | same as above                                            | Group A    |
# | ate  | same as above                                            | Group A    |
# | tan  | `'a':1, 'n':1, 't':1` â†’ different key                    | Group B    |
# | nat  | same as above                                            | Group B    |
# | bat  | `'a':1, 'b':1, 't':1` â†’ different key                    | Group C    |

# So output:

# ```python
# [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]
# ```

# ---

# ## âœ… Summary

# | Aspect                     | Character Frequency Approach      |
# |---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
# | âœ… Fast                   | O(N*K), no sorting involved       |
# | âœ… Accurate               | Accounts for letter **counts**    |
# | âœ… Hashable key           | Using `tuple(count)`              |
# | ðŸ”§ Needs lowercase input | Assumes only `'a'` to `'z'`        |
